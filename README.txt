This is a modified version of Vv285 slides by Horst Hohberger, as you can see it is designed at the style of Ann Arbor, closely related to our institute.

When you try to run this code there are several points you need to pay attention to:

1. Make sure that you have installed all those packages listed in the preamble.(Including the prerequisite packages needed for the beamer.cls, refer to relevant materials for help)

2. The path of the graphics defined in the preamble (Line 11 on my PC) is written to my need. So you need to change the path and let the WinEdt know that

where your pictures are stored at (they are in another file).

3. Better run this .tex by PDFTeXify.

That's all I can consider by now. If you have any further concerns, please let me know.
